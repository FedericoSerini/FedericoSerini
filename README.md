# Federico Serini

Software Engineer who is exploring DevOps deeply and I will track my progress here, considering to switch career. After a long time using just GUI applications, I started to use just plain terminal and I liked it and I will not come back.

I have also an interest in Big Data and Data Engineering.

## About my tech stack

Currently, I am focusing on AWS and I will probably stick to it. Java is the language that I use the most but I am transitioning to Go and Python
